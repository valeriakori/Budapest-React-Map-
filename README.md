## Budapest - The City That Unites (offical city slogan)

The city that I spend 3 months, had the most interesting internship (Linguarum on the map), met incredible people and found the inspiration to start coding in.
Exactly one year later I am finishing up my last Udacity project. I remember it like it was yesterday that I sat in my room (in my house in budapest *singing*, Casa Baja on the map) and wrote my application for the Google Udacity Nanodegree Scholarship Challenge. The last year has probably been the most exhausting but rewarding, interesting and fun of my life. Bp made me transition careers to a path that seemed out of my reach.

At this place I would like to thank everyone who has been a part of my journey into programming, my **friends in Bp**, my extremly educational internship and boss **Gabor**, the whole **Udacity community** and last but not least my **boyfriend** who always cheered me up when I had a meltdown because I couldn't figure something out.
